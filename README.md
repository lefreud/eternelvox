# EternelVox

EternelVox is a Chrome extension that removes the struggle from constantly logging into Omnivox.

This extension was created specifically to work with Cégep Limoilou's Omnivox but it should work with any other Cégep using Omnivox.

The extension has the following features:
- Refresh any page matching `https://*.omnivox.ca/*` periodically, in intervals of 55 minutes.
- Save the login credentials locally and automatically submit the login form when disconnected (optional, can be turned off inside a nice popup).

This extension is a modified version of [uLav Fresh](https://github.com/lefreud/ulav-fresh), a Chrome extension for Université Laval's online portal.
